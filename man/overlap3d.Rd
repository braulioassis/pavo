\usage{
overlap3d(
  colsp1,
  colsp2,
  plot = FALSE,
  interactive = TRUE,
  col = c("blue", "red", "darkgrey"),
  fill = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{colsp1}{(required) data frame, possibly a result from the \code{\link[=colspace]{colspace()}}
function, containing
values for the 'x', 'y' (and possibly 'z') coordinates as columns (labeled as such)}

\item{colsp2}{(required) data frame, possibly a result from the \code{\link[=colspace]{colspace()}}
function, containing
values for the 'x', 'y' (and possibly 'z') coordinates as columns (labeled as such)}

\item{plot}{logical. Should the volumes and points be plotted? (defaults to \code{FALSE}).
This only works for tetrahedral colourspaces at the moment.}

\item{interactive}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, uses the rgl engine for interactive plotting;
if \code{FALSE} then a static plot is generated.}

\item{col}{a vector of length 3 with the colours for (in order) the first volume,
the second volume, and the overlap.}

\item{fill}{logical. should the two volumes be filled in the plot? (defaults to \code{FALSE})}

\item{new}{logical. Should a new plot window be called? If \code{FALSE}, volumes and their
overlap are plotted over the current plot (defaults to \code{TRUE}).}

\item{nsamp}{the number of points to be sampled. Stoddard & Stevens(2011) use
around 750,000 points, but more or fewer might be required depending on the
degree of overlap.}

\item{psize}{deprecated argument}

\item{lwd}{if \code{plot = TRUE}, sets the line width for volume grids.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to the plot. See \code{\link[=vol]{vol()}}}
}
\value{
a data.frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \verb{s_in1, s_in2} the number of sampled points that fall within each of the
volumes individually.
\item \code{s_inboth} the number of sampled points that fall within both volumes.
\item \code{s_ineither} the number of points that fall within either of the volumes.
\item \code{psmallest} the proportion of points that fall within both volumes divided
by the number of points that fall within the smallest volume.
\item \code{pboth} the proportion of points that fall within both volumes divided by
the total number of points that fall within both volumes.
}

If the Monte Carlo solution is used, a number of points much greater than the default should be
considered
